          To me when I was growing up, "living the dream" looked like coaching
          tennis all I could, and now I am living that dream! I have
          grown to love tennis so much and have had success playing it primarily
          because I had passionate and energetic coaches all throughout my
          junior training who would go out of their way to help me. With VIVA
          Tennis I hope to bring that same passion and energy to this wonderful
          sport to help the next generation of tennis players!

          Since the first time I picked up a racket as a child, tennis has had
          my heart. For as long as I can remember my goals and aspirations have
          been tied up in the sport. I can't wait for the opportunity to help
          others come to love tennis as I have. In my experience as a
          competitive high school athlete and as a coach I have learned the
          importance of enjoying every minute spent on court. I look forward to
          bringing that excitement and love for the sport to VIVA Tennis.

        <p>
          I have played tennis practically my whole life, and have worked hard
          to become the player that I am right now. I have had many great
          coaches that have helped me to become what I am today, but none of
          them have been as important as my mom. She has always been there to
          hit with me and coach me. She has also been there to encourage me to
          take every opportunity to improve. That is what a good coach can do
          and I hope to help other people accomplish their goals with VIVA
          Tennis.
