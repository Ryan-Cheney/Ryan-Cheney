            To me when I was growing up, "living the dream" looked like coaching
            tennis all I could, and now I am living that dream! I have grown to
            love tennis so much and have had success playing it primarily
            because I had passionate and energetic coaches all throughout my
            junior training who would go out of their way to help me. With VIVA
            Tennis I hope to bring that same passion and energy to this
            wonderful sport to help the next generation of tennis players!

            Since the first time I picked up a racket as a child, tennis has had
            my heart. For as long as I can remember my goals and aspirations
            have been tied up in the sport. I can't wait for the opportunity to
            help others come to love tennis as I have. In my experience as a
            competitive high school athlete and as a coach I have learned the
            importance of enjoying every minute spent on court. I look forward
            to bringing that excitement and love for the sport to VIVA Tennis.

            I have played tennis practically my whole life, and have worked hard
            to become the player that I am right now. I have had many great
            coaches that have helped me to become what I am today, but none of
            them have been as important as my mom. She has always been there to
            hit with me and coach me. She has also been there to encourage me to
            take every opportunity to improve. That is what a good coach can do
            and I hope to help other people accomplish their goals with VIVA
            Tennis.
